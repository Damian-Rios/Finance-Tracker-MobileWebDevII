## Project Overview
The Finance Tracker App is a mobile application developed with React Native and Expo that helps users track their income and expenses.

**Transaction Logging:** Users can add their income and expenses with details like amount, date, and category.

**Monthly Summary:** Displays a financial summary showing the total income, expenses, and balance for the current month.

**Visual Data Representation:** Features pie charts for income vs. expenses and bar charts to show income and expenses for each month.

**Responsive Design:** The app is optimized for both Android and iOS devices using React Native.

## Technologies Used
